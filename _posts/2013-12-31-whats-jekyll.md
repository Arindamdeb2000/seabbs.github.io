I aim to use this website as a personal aggrigator of all my output, both academic, and personal. I also intend to use it as a testing ground for improving my grasp of html, command line interfaces and jekyll (a static site generator)

# Site outline

The main purpose of this site is to collate all of my research output into a single easily searched repository linking papers, code, talks and future workshops. I also aim to inlcude web sources that I regularly read, such as my feedly stream. Ideally this would allow me to share my interests to a wider audiance, but also collate them within a single site to make my own web browsing more efficient. 

I plan on implementing additional features, such as a twitter plug in, new page layouts, links to other project web sites, and additionl social media

Additionally I plan on writing a monthly blog article covering a new technical subject each time.

Lastly I plan on collating interesting news stories from across the world relating to my research interests
