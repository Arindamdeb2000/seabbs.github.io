# Biography

I am a mathematical modeller interested in developing and fitting models for infectious disease, using data driven approaches. I studied Mathematics at the University of Durham, completing an MMath degree in 2014. I then completed a Masters in Advanced Mathematical Biology at the University of York. As part of my thesis project I spent a summer at the University of Glasgow, studying the patterns of drug resistance in E-coli. across various species in Tanzanaia. I am currently completing a PhD in social medicine at the University of Bristol, studying the deployment of the BCG vaccine in the UK.
