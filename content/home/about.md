# Biography

I am a mathematical modeller and data scientist interested in using data-driven approaches to develop models to help understand the world. I studied Mathematics at the University of Durham, completing an MMath degree in 2014. I then completed a Masters in Advanced Mathematical Biology at the University of York. As part of my thesis project, I spent a summer at the University of Glasgow, studying the patterns of drug resistance in E-coli. across various species in Tanzania. I am currently completing a PhD in social medicine at the University of Bristol, studying the deployment of the BCG vaccine in the UK. Previously, I worked as a data scientist at [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/) developing predictive models and conducting ad hoc analysis.
