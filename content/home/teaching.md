I developed and teach several practicals for an infectious disease modelling short course at the University of Bristol. See [here](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/medical-school/study/short-courses/essentials-of-infectious-disease-modelling-and-economic-evaluation/) for course details and [here](https://bristolmathmodellers.github.io/biddmodellingcourse/) for open source resources.
