<p>This interactive dashboard uses data on Tuberculosis incidence from 1913-1916 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-tb-annual-notifications-1913-onwards">released</a> by Public Health England and combines it with data on the interventions against Tuberculosis that have been discovered/implemented over the last century. The data was cleaned and imported into R using the <a href="https://www.samabbott.co.uk/tbinenglanddataclean/">tbinenglanddataclean</a> R package, which also contains information on how to apply for additional data, scripts to clean data extracts and graphing functions to visualise them. The dashboard is a work in progress and additional interventions, new figures and increased interactivity will be added over time. For a full page view of the dashboard see <a href="http://www.seabbs.co.uk/shiny/TB_England_Wales">here</a>.</p>
