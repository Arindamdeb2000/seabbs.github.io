```

[Last week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48810060?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cmj34zmwxx1t/tuberculosis&link_location=live-reporting-story) the UK pledged to contribute £467m a year for three years to the Global Fund. The money will be spent on: providing tuberculosis (TB) treatment for more than two million people; 90 million mosquito nets to protect people from malaria; and treatment for more than three million people living with HIV. This funding will drastically improve many peoples lives and needs to be celebrated even if it comes from a broadly unpopular source.

Whilst the Global Fund has helped [save more than 27 million lives](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-calls-on-g20-leaders-to-step-up-the-fight-against-deadly-diseases?sf104862388=1) since 2002 all three diseases continue to have a devastating impact with TB remaining as one of the top ten causes of death worldwide, and the number one cause of death from an infectious disease. More research and funding is needed to continue to reduce the incidence, and negative consequences, of these diseases.

In this post, I will be celebrating this funding by repeating/adapting some previous work visualising trends in Tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates but now using GIFs. The starting point for this post is the storyboard below (from a [previous post](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/gettbinr-6-0/)). Using the code for each plot I will work through animating them using [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/index.html) (by [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://github.com/thomasp85)).

![](/img/getTBinR/storyboard-6-0.png)

This storyboard shows the trends in regional/global TB incidence rates, as well as the annual percentage change in incidence rates, both globally, and on a country level (ridge plots). [`getTBinR`](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/getTBinR/) was used to produce all of the figures excepting the ridge plots which were generated using [`ggridges`](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggridges). See [here](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/img/getTBinR/storyboard-6-0.png) for a full size version.


`gganimate` was recently reworked to be a complimentary grammar to that used in `ggplot` - rather than as an additional dimension of it. The rework comes with some interesting new features - the [release post](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2019/gganimate-has-transitioned-to-a-state-of-release/) is well worth a read! Another motivation for this post is to explore some of these features.


## Packages

Here we use `pacman` to handle downloading and loading the required `rstats` packages. See the comments below for external dependencies.

```{r packages}
## Get required packages - managed using pacman
if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman)
p_load("getTBinR")
p_load("tidyverse")
p_load("scales")
p_load("viridis")
p_load("gifski") ##requires cargo on ubuntu
p_load("magick") ## requires libmagick++-dev on ubuntu
p_load_gh("thomasp85/gganimate")
```

## Data

`getTbinR` handles downloading and cleaning the TB surveillance data provided by the World Health Organization. See [here](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/getTBinR/dev/reference/get_tb_burden.html) for details. 

```{r get-data}
## Pull TB data 
tb_burden <- get_tb_burden(verbose = FALSE) 

tb_burden

## Pull the data dictionarty
tb_dict <- get_data_dict(verbose = FALSE)

tb_dict
```

## Setup

The first step (though not the most exciting) is to define what size all the gifs in this post should be. 

```{r}
gif_width <- 720
gif_height <- 720
```


## Regional TB incidence rates

The code below uses some of the built-in in functionality from `getTBinR` to generate a summary figure showing trends in regional TB incidence rates. `gganimate::transition_reveal` is then used to make this `ggplot` into a GIF that reveals a data point at  a time. The `gganimate::transition_` family of functions interpret the plot data in order to somehow distribute it over a number of frames. See the [`gganimate` documentation](https://gganimate.com/reference/index.html) for the full list of transitions.


```{r plot-tb-summary}
## Regional and Global TB incidence rates over time
regional_incidence <- plot_tb_burden_summary(conf = NULL, compare_to_world = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Tuberculosis (TB) Incidence Rates",
         subtitle = "By Region",
         caption = "") +
  facet_wrap(~Area, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(size=22)) +
  ##gganimate code
  transition_reveal(year)

## Animate
regional_incidence_gif <- animate(regional_incidence, 
                                  width = gif_width,
                                  height = gif_height)

## Print
regional_incidence_gif
```

## Summarise the annual percentage change in TB incidence rates.

We again use some of the functionality from `getTbinR` to estimate the annual percentage in TB incidence rates globally. 

```{r}
## Summarise global changes
global_tb <- summarise_tb_burden(compare_to_world = TRUE,
                                 annual_change = TRUE,
                                 stat = "rate",
                                 verbose = FALSE) %>% 
  filter(area == "Global")
```

Here `ggplot` is used to produce a basic line plot and then `gganimate` is used to turn this into a GIF (as above).

```{r annual-change}
## Global annual change
global_annual_change <- ggplot(global_tb, aes(year, e_inc_num)) +
  geom_line(col = "black", size = 1.4, alpha = 0.6) +
  ## geom_point needs a year based group so that it renders correctly in the gif
  geom_point(size = 1.6, alpha = 1, col = "black", aes(group = seq_along(year))) + 
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::percent, minor_breaks = NULL, breaks = seq(-0.025, 0, 0.0025)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    y = "Annual % Change",
    x = "Year",
    title = "Global Annual % Change in Tuberculosis Incidence Rates",
    caption = ""
  ) + 
  ##gganimate code
  transition_reveal(year)

## Animate the gif
global_annual_change_gif <- animate(global_annual_change, width = gif_width, height = gif_height)

## Print
global_annual_change_gif
```


## Country level annual percentage change in TB incidence rates.

This repeats the steps from above but rather than summarising everything at a global level keeps the country level data. Countries with low incidence rates (< 10 per 100,000) or with very few cases (< 1000) have been filtered out to reduce the noise in the data.

```{r}
## Remove countries with incidence below 1000 or incidence rates below 10 per 100,000 to reduce noise and cal country level annual change.
countries_with_tb_burden <- tb_burden %>% 
  filter(year == 2017,
         e_inc_100k > 10,
         e_inc_num > 1000) %>% 
  pull(country)

tb_annual_change <- summarise_tb_burden(countries = countries_with_tb_burden, 
                                        compare_to_region = FALSE, 
                                        compare_to_world = FALSE,
                                        metric = "e_inc_100k",
                                        annual_change = TRUE,
                                        stat = "mean",
                                        verbose = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(annual_change = e_inc_100k) %>% 
  left_join(tb_burden %>% 
              select(country, g_whoregion), 
                     by = c("area" = "country")) %>% 
  drop_na(g_whoregion)
```


We now define a density plotting function for this data.

```{r}
## Function to plot annual change
plot_annual_change <- function(df, strat = NULL, title = NULL, subtitle = NULL, years = 2000:2017) {
  dist <- df %>% 
    filter(year %in% years) %>% 
    rename(Region = g_whoregion) %>% 
    mutate(year = year %>% 
             factor(ordered = TRUE) %>% 
             fct_rev) %>% 
    ggplot(aes_string(x = "annual_change", fill = strat)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
    scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, end = 0.9) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, end = 0.9) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2, alpha = 0.6) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent, breaks = seq(-0.4, 0.4, 0.1),
                       limits = c(-0.4, 0.4), minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    labs(x = paste0("Annual Change in ", search_data_dict("e_inc_100k")$definition),
         y = "Density",
         title = title,
         subtitle = subtitle,
         caption = "")
  
  return(dist)
}
```

Using `plot_annual_change` we can now generate first a `ggplot` density of plot of the annual percentage change in countries TB incidence rates. This is again transformed into a GIF using `gganimate`. 

Rather than using `gganimate::transition_reveal` as before, here we use `gganimate::transition_states` followed  by `gganimate::shadow_trail`. Also, rather than revealing a data point each time, we plot a single density plot for each group instead (here that grouping is by year) and leave a shadow of the previous density plots. `{frame}` has been used here to show which year is being plotted. Note we could have used `transition_time` and `{frame_time}` here but this was producing an error for me. 
```{r}
overall <- plot_annual_change(tb_annual_change, "'grey'",
                   years = 2001:2017,
                   title = "Distribution of the Annual % Change in TB Incidence Rates by Country",
                   subtitle = "Year: {2001 + round(16 * frame / nframes, 0)}")  +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "grey") + 
  ## gganimate code
  transition_states(year) +
  shadow_trail(alpha = alpha / 10, colour = "grey")

## Animate
overall_gif <- animate(overall, width = gif_width, height = gif_height)

## Print
overall_gif
```

As above, this plots density of the annual percentage change in countries TB incidence rates but now stratified by region. 

```{r}
region <- plot_annual_change(tb_annual_change, "Region",
                             title = "Distribution of the Annual % Change in TB Incidence Rates by Country",
                             subtitle = "By Region - Year: {2001 + round(16 * frame / nframes, 0)}",
                             years = 2001:2017) + 
  facet_wrap(~Region, scales = "free_y") + 
  labs(caption =  "@seabbs | Using #getTBinR and #gganimate | Data sourced from: World Health Organization") + 
  ## gganimate code
  transition_states(year) +
  shadow_trail(alpha = alpha / 10, colour = "grey")

## Animate
region_gif <- animate(region, width = gif_width, height = gif_height)

## Print
region_gif
```

## Build a storyboard GIF

The code generates a storyboard GIF made up of all the GIFs in this post. It is based on a [great example](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/wiki/Animation-Composition) by [Matt Crump](https://github.com/CrumpLab), using `magick` to attach the individual images in each GIF together. See [here](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/img/getTBinR/storyboard-gif.gif) for a full size version of the storyboard and [here](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/img/getTBinR/storyboard-gif.png) for a static image of the end result


```{r}
## Read in gif images
regional_incidence_mgif <- image_read(regional_incidence_gif)
global_annual_change_mgif <- image_read(global_annual_change_gif)


overall_mgif <- image_read(overall_gif)
region_mgif <- image_read(region_gif)


## Combine first image into a single storyboard
storyboard_gif <- image_append(c(
  image_append(c(regional_incidence_mgif[1], global_annual_change_mgif[1])), 
  image_append(c(overall_mgif[1], region_mgif[1]))),
  stack = TRUE
)

## Loop through each frame, compose a storyboard, and add to storyboard gif
for (i in 2:100) {
  storyboard_gif <- c(storyboard_gif, 
                      image_append(c(
  image_append(c(regional_incidence_mgif[i], global_annual_change_mgif[i])), 
  image_append(c(overall_mgif[i], region_mgif[i]))),
  stack = TRUE
))
}

## Save the gif - warning this takes around 10 minutes on my machine (https://www.samabbott.co.uk/post/building-an-rstats-workstation/)
anim_save("../../static/img/getTBinR/storyboard-gif.gif", storyboard_gif)
```

## Wrap-up 

Hopefully this post was a fun way of celebrating the UK's funding commitment to the Global Fund and provided some insights into how to make GIFs in `rstats`.  In terms of understanding the data I am not sure that using GIFs here offers much over the previous implementation but I am very happy to be proved wrong - let me know what you think. The map from the original storyboard was not reproduced as a GIF as there was no easy way to do so using the original code - watch this space.

For other examples of using `getTBinR` to visualise the WHO TB data see [my](https://gist.github.com/seabbs) gists, previous blog [posts](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/tags/who/), and the [`getTBinR` website](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/getTBinR/). To start using `getTBinR` in your browser see [here](http://www.seabbs.co.uk/shiny/ExploreGlobalTB/) for a shiny app or [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/seabbs/getTBinR/master?urlpath=rstudio) for an Rstudio client hosted by [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org). Tweet at [me](https://twitter.com/seabbs) if you use any of these resources to make something!

`gganimate` has a great [wiki](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/wiki) with numerous other examples as well as a detailed [vignette](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html). There is alot more functionality than that covered here so I recommended diving in with a dataset and seeing what you can create.

If interested in TB research see [here](http://bit.ly/seabbs-google-scholar) for a list of my papers/preprints and [here](http://bit.ly/seabbs-code) for the corresponding, fully reproducible, code.
