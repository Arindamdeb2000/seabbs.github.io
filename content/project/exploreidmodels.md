It is designed to be used as a teaching aid when introducing people to the concepts behind infectious disease models without requiring them to interact with the underlying code. A number of infectious disease models are included, such as a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered model. Source code available [here](https://www.github.com/seabbs/exploreidmodels)."
