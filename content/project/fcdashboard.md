summary = "FC dashboard is a simple tool for exploratory data analysis on the [funding circle loanbook](https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/seabbs/fcdashboard). This is an independant project and is in no way associated with funding circle. Since the original development of this dashboard Funding Circle has stopped publishing it's full loanbook, this means that some functionality will no longer work as originally intended and that data will no longer be updated."
