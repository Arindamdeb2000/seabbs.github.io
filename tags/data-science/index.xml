      <description>Why? I regularly use cloud resources (AWS and GCP) both in my day job and for personal projects but recently I have been finding that having to spin up a cloud instance for quick analysis can be tedious, even when making use of tools for reproducibility like docker. This is particularly the case for self-learning when spending money on cloud resources feels wasteful, especially when I have half an eye on something else (i.</description>
