      <description>Why? I recently built out a new workstation and have done some benchmarking using xgboost via h2o. In this post I am using the benchmarkme package to get another perspective on performance. Note: The benchmarkme package appears to have some issues when it comes to plotting benchmarks. I ended up having to drop them entirely from this post. **Update (2019-02-11): Just checked this issue using rocker/tidyverse:latest and found all benchmarkme functionality is working well.</description>

      <description>Why? I recently built out a new workstation to give me some local compute for data science workloads. Now that I have local access to both a CPU with a large number of cores (Threadripper 1950X with 16 cores) and a moderately powerful GPU (Nvidia RTX 2070), I’m interested in knowing when it is best to use CPU vs. GPU for some of the tasks that I commonly do.</description>
